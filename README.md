# Parkinson's Disease Detection Project
## Tom Ritman-Meer using Google Colaboratory
In this notebook I investigated a labelled data set with 22 patient feature variables and a single column indicating the status of the Parkinson's Disease diagnosis, 1 indicating the presence of the disease and 0 its absence. Using a range of machine learning models I demonstrate that the presence of Parkinson's Disease can be predicted extremely accurately using the feature variables, suggesting that machine learning could be a valuable diagnostic tool to aid clinicians in their diagnosis of this disease.
